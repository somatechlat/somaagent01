"""Top-level package for SomaAgent01 source code.

This file makes the ``src`` directory a proper Python package, enabling imports
such as ``import src.core.config`` used throughout the project (e.g., in
``services/common/runtime_config.py``).  No additional symbols are exported –
the package merely exists to satisfy the import system.
