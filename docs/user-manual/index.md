# SomaAgent01 User Manual

Welcome to the SomaAgent01 User Manual. This handbook explains how to deploy, configure, and operate the agent stack from a user perspective. Each section is validated against the documentation checklist—purpose, prerequisites, procedures, verification, and references—so you always know what to do and how to confirm success.

## How to Use This Manual

- **Start with Quick Wins:** Follow the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) guide to launch the stack in minutes.
- **Go Deeper:** The [Feature Playbook](./using-the-agent.md) covers day-to-day tasks in the Web UI, including file management and multi-agent orchestration.
- **Stay Operational:** When something goes wrong, the [Troubleshooting Matrix](./troubleshooting.md) provides decision trees, log breadcrumbs, and escalation paths.
- **Learn the Vocabulary:** Refer to the [Glossary](../glossary.md) for canonical terminology.

> [!TIP]
> All user-facing procedures include a "Verification" section so you can confirm that the step completed successfully before moving on.
