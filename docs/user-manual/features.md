# Features Overview

**Standards**: ISO/IEC 29148§5.3

## Core Features

### Conversational Interface

Chat with the AI assistant using natural language. The agent understands context and maintains conversation history.

**Example**:
```
User: What's the weather like?
Agent: I'll search for current weather information...
```

### Code Execution

The agent can write and execute code in multiple languages:
- Python
- JavaScript
- Bash/Shell
- SQL

**Example**:
```
User: Calculate the factorial of 10
Agent: [Writes Python code, executes it, returns result]
```

### Memory System

Persistent memory across sessions:
- **Short-term**: Current conversation context
- **Long-term**: Facts, preferences, solutions stored in SomaBrain

**Example**:
```
User: Remember my email is user@example.com
Agent: ✅ Saved to memory
```

### Multi-Agent Cooperation

Delegate complex tasks to subordinate agents:
- Main agent breaks down tasks
- Subordinates work in parallel
- Results aggregated and reported back

**Example**:
```
User: Analyze these 5 datasets simultaneously
Agent: Creating 5 subordinate agents...
```
