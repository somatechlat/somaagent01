# SomaAgent01 Feature Playbook

This playbook documents the day-to-day workflows available through the SomaAgent01 web UI. Every workflow lists prerequisites, the procedure, and a verification step.

## Control Panel Essentials

### Restart the Framework

**Purpose:** Safely reinitialize the backend without leaving the UI.

**Procedure:**
1. Click **Restart** in the sidebar.
2. Confirm the prompt when asked.

**Verification:** A blue "Restarting" toast appears, followed by a green "Restarted" toast. The chat history persists.

### Manage Chats

- **New Chat:** Clears current context and starts fresh.
- **Reset Chat:** Deletes cached memory for the active chat.
- **Save Chat:** Downloads the conversation JSON to `/tmp/chats`.
- **Load Chat:** Restores a saved transcript for replay.

> [!TIP]
> Name saved chats after the task (`vector-search-audit.json`) to aid reuse.

## Action Buttons & Context Frames

| Button | Role | Verification |
| ------ | ---- | ------------ |
| Pause/Resume Agent | Temporarily halt or resume tool invocations | Button label toggles; tasks stop immediately |
| Import Knowledge | Upload domain files into `/knowledge/custom/main` | Success toast indicating stored path |
| Context | Inspect the full prompt, instructions, and memory | Drawer opens with system prompts and messages |
| History | Review the latest JSON request payload | Drawer shows the serialized exchange |
| Nudge | Replays the last agent step | A retry log entry appears in the transcript |

## File Browser Operations

1. Open the file icon in the top navigation.
2. Use the breadcrumb navigator to switch directories (`Up` returns to parent path).
3. Upload, download, rename, or delete files using the inline icons.

**Verification:** Newly uploaded files appear in the listing with correct size and timestamp.

> [!NOTE]
> The working directory for agents remains `/work_dir` even if the browser lets you navigate the container root.

## Tooling and Prompt Engineering

### Invoke Multi-Tool Workflows

1. Provide a concise objective and tool hints (e.g., "Use `search_engine` then `code_execution_tool`").
2. Review the task plan generated by SomaAgent01.
3. Approve the plan or add constraints (time limits, data sources).
4. Monitor tool execution in the right-hand pane.

**Verification:** The final response cites tools used and the artifacts generated (files, URLs).

### Prompt Iteration Best Practices

- Be explicit about outputs ("Return a CSV with columns date, price, sentiment").
- Break complex tasks into sequenced subtasks.
- Use follow-up messages to refine, rather than rewriting instructions.

## Voice Interface

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)

1. Activate the **Speech** toggle in the sidebar.
2. Listen to the agent response.
3. Click **Stop Speech** to interrupt playback.

**Verification:** Audio output matches the current message and stops on demand.

### Speech-to-Text (STT)

1. Click the microphone icon.
2. Speak your instruction. Watch the color-coded status (red → recording, teal → processing).
3. Release to send.

**Verification:** The transcribed text appears in the chat input and submits automatically.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All STT/TTS processing occurs inside the container. No audio data is sent to external APIs unless explicitly configured.

## Marketplace & Capsules

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:7002/marketplace.html` while the stack is running.
2. Browse the capsule catalog served by the gateway (`/v1/capsules`).
3. Install a capsule; monitor response banners for signature status.
4. Validate the artifact in the registry `installed/` directory.

**Verification:** The capsule appears in the installed list and exposes new tools in the UI.

## Backup & Restore

1. Open **Settings → Backup**.
2. Click **Create Backup** and confirm included directories.
3. Download the ZIP archive.
4. To restore, upload the archive via **Restore from Backup**, choose overwrite rules, and confirm.

**Verification:** Backup archive contains knowledge, memory, chats, and configuration files. After restore, settings and history match the source environment.

## Accessibility Commitments

- The UI supports keyboard navigation for primary controls.
- Screen readers announce agent messages and status toasts.
- Color usage meets WCAG AA contrast ratios.

See the [Accessibility Statement](./accessibility.md) for detailed conformance notes.

## When Things Break

If you encounter errors or degraded performance:

- Check Docker logs for stack traces.
- Review the [Troubleshooting & FAQ](./troubleshooting.md) decision tree.
- Escalate to the on-call channel if verification fails twice.
