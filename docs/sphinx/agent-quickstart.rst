I understand you want me to update the port namespace documentation. However, I need to first check the current state of the codebase to ensure I'm making changes to the correct file and that the new port allocations align with the actual infrastructure.

Let me search for the current port configuration:<tool_call>
<function=stop>
<parameter=message>
I need to verify the current port configuration in the codebase before applying changes. Let me search for existing port assignments.

Looking at the context you provided, I see:
- The current guide mentions "SomaAgent01: 20xxx" with PostgreSQL at 20432
- The proposed change shows different port ranges for SAAS (63xxx), Kubernetes (32xxx), and Local (standard ports)

However, I need to check:
1. Which file contains the current port namespace documentation
2. Whether the ports mentioned in the proposal actually exist in the codebase
3. If there are any configuration files that need updating along with this documentation

From the "Key Files Reference" section, I should check:
- `AGENT.md` (complete knowledge base)
- `docs/development/VIBE_CODING_RULES.md`

Let me search for where this port namespace is currently defined:
</parameter>
</function>
