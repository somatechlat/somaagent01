	integration: marks tests that require real external services (e.g., Postgres, Kafka). Set RUN_INTEGRATION=1 to include.
	smoke: quick end-to-end UI smoke tests run against a live gateway (uses Playwright).
	chat: optional chat flow tests that send a message and await assistant; gated by RUN_CHAT_SMOKE=1.
