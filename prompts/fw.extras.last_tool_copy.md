You can copy and paste the result of the last tool call of {{tool_name}} beginning with "{{last_tool_output_preview}}" into any of the next tool's arguments.
To paste the full content into any next tool's argument, insert the literal token '{last_tool_output}' in the string where you want the content to appear. It will be replaced automatically before the tool runs.
