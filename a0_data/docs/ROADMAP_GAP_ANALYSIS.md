# SomaAgent 01 – Roadmap Gap Analysis
**Generated**: October 4, 2025  
**Status**: Sprint 0-1B Complete (~60%), Sprint 2+ Planning

## Executive Summary

The SomaAgent 01 codebase has successfully implemented the core event-driven architecture with Kafka, Redis, and Postgres. Core services (Gateway, Conversation Worker, Tool Executor, Delegation Gateway) are operational with basic telemetry and policy integration. However, critical production-readiness components are missing: Kubernetes deployment, automated testing, observability dashboards, and multi-tenant isolation.

**Overall Progress: 50-60% of Sprint 0-1B deliverables complete**
